\details{
Internally it uses a combination of pyExec and print. Please note that
         the result of pyExecp("x") and pyPrint("x") often will be different, 
         since pyExecp("x") is equivalent to typing x into the Python terminal
         whereas pyPrint("x") is equivalent to typing print(x) into the Python 
         terminal.
